This is just a folder to keep some algorithms I wrote or implemented.

`FixItAlgorithm` is an implementation of the Algorithmic Local Lemma, aka Moser's FIX-IT algorithm in order to solve an exercise out of `The Probabilistic Method` by Noga Alon and Joel Spencer. It just consists of the program and some exposition, my theoretical analysis is separate. The exercise was an absolute pleasure, and very instructive for this awesome piece of literature.
